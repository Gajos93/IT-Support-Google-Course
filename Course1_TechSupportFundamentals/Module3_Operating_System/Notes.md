# 💻 Course 1 – Module 3: Operating Systems

## 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Operating System (OS)** 🖥️ – manages hardware, software, and provides the user interface.  
- **Kernel** 🧠 – the OS core that handles processes, memory, device drivers, and hardware communication.  

---

### 🛠️ OS Responsibilities
- **Process Management** 🔄 – handles running programs and multitasking.  
- **Memory Management** 📦 – allocates RAM to processes efficiently.  
- **File System Management** 📂 – organizes data into files and directories.  
- **User Interfaces** 🖱️⌨️ – Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI).  

---

### 🖥️ Virtualization
- **Virtualization Software** 🧩 – e.g., VirtualBox, VMware; runs multiple OSes on one physical machine.  
- **VM (Virtual Machine)** 🖥️ – a simulated computer running inside another system.  
- **Hypervisor** ⚙️ – software layer that manages VMs (Type 1 = bare metal, Type 2 = hosted).  

---

### ⌨️ Command-Line Tools
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** 💻 – text-based interaction with the OS.  
- **Shell** 🐚 – program that interprets text commands for the OS.  
- **PowerShell** 🔷 – Windows-specific advanced shell with scripting capabilities.  
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** 🐧 – common shell in Linux/Unix systems.

## 📝 Important Notes
- **Networking Basics** 🌐  
  - **IP Address** 🔢 – unique identifier for a device on a network.  
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)** 📖 – translates domain names into IP addresses.  
  - **ICMP (ping)** 🏓 – tests network connectivity.  

- **System Logs** 📜 – record system events; essential for troubleshooting and auditing.  
- **User Management** 👥 – create/delete accounts, manage permissions and groups.  
- **Linux vs Windows vs macOS** 🐧🪟🍏 – different OS families, but share core responsibilities.

## 💡 Insights
- The **kernel is the heart of the OS** – without it, nothing works.  
- **Virtualization** allows labs and testing environments without multiple physical computers.  
- **CLI knowledge** is critical for IT support – faster and more powerful than GUI in many cases.
