# 📖 Course 1 – Module 2: Hardware - Terminology

## 🔢 Core Concepts
- **Binary System** ⚫⚪ – base-2 numeral system (0s and 1s), the foundation of computer operations.  
- **Motherboard** 🔗 – the main circuit board connecting all computer components.  

---

## 💾 Memory
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ⚡ – volatile, temporary storage for active data and processes.  
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** 💾 – permanent memory storing essential startup instructions.  
- **Cache Memory** ⚡📥 – very fast memory inside the CPU that speeds up data access.  

---

## ⚙️ Processors
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** 🧠 – the "brain" of the computer that executes instructions.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** 🎨 – specialized processor for graphics rendering and parallel tasks.  

---

## 💽 Storage
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** 📀 – mechanical storage using spinning platters and a read/write arm.  
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)** ⚡ – faster storage with no moving parts.  
- **File System** 📂 – the structure an OS uses to organize and manage files (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4).  

---

## 🛠️ System Firmware & Startup
- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** 🧪 – diagnostic test run at startup to check hardware.  
- **BIOS/UEFI** ⚙️ – low-level firmware that initializes hardware and loads the bootloader/OS.  

---

## 🔌 Other Key Components
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)** 🔋 – converts AC electricity into usable DC power for the system.  
- **Buses** 🔀 – communication pathways between CPU, memory, and peripherals.  
- **Peripherals** 🖱️⌨️🖨️ – external devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer.  

- **File system**: The method and structure an OS uses to organize files and directories.
