# 🖥️ Course 1 – Module 2: Hardware

## 📝 Notes

### 🔹 Hardware Basics
- **Hardware** 🧩 – the physical parts of a computer.  
- Four main categories:  
  - **Input devices** ⌨️🖱️ – keyboard, mouse, scanner.  
  - **Output devices** 🖥️🖨️ – monitor, printer, speakers.  
  - **Storage devices** 💽 – HDDs, SSDs, flash drives.  
  - **Processing devices** ⚙️ – CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM.  

---

### 🔹 CPU & GPU
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** 🧠 – the “brain” of the computer; executes instructions.  
- Works with **cache memory** to speed up access to frequently used data.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** 🎨 – specialized in rendering images and handling parallel tasks (also used for AI, scientific computing).  

---

### 🔹 Memory
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ⚡ – volatile memory used for active processes; erased when power is off.  
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** 💾 – permanent memory holding startup instructions (e.g., BIOS/UEFI).  
- **Cache Memory** ⚡📥 – extremely fast memory located inside the CPU.  

---

### 🔹 Storage
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** 📀 – mechanical, uses spinning platters; larger capacity but slower.  
- **SSD (Solid-State Drive)** ⚡ – no moving parts, much faster and more reliable.  
- **Flash Memory** 🔋 – used in USB drives, SD cards.  
- **Storage Hierarchy** 🏗️ – Cache → RAM → SSD/HDD → External storage. The closer to CPU, the faster but smaller.  

---

### 🔹 Motherboard & Components
- **Motherboard** 🔗 – the main circuit board connecting all components.  
- Contains **buses** 🔀 (data, address, control) to transfer signals.  
- Includes **expansion slots (PCIe)** 🧩 for adding cards (network, sound, graphics).  
- Requires **cooling systems** ❄️ (fans, heat sinks, thermal paste, liquid cooling).  
- Powered by **PSU (Power Supply Unit)** 🔌 converting AC to DC.  

---

### 🔹 Boot & Firmware
- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** 🧪 – diagnostic run at startup.  
- **BIOS/UEFI** ⚙️ – firmware initializing hardware and starting the bootloader.  
- **Boot Process** 🚀 – POST → BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader → Operating System.  

---

### 🔹 File Systems & Peripherals
- **File System** 📂 – organizes data into files and directories (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4).  
- **Peripherals** 🖱️⌨️🖨️ – external devices adding functionality.  

---

## 📖 Key Terms

- **Binary System** ⚫⚪ – base-2 number system using only 0s and 1s.  
- **Motherboard** 🔗 – main circuit board connecting all components.  
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ⚡ – temporary storage for active data.  
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** 💾 – permanent storage containing startup instructions.  
- **Cache Memory** ⚡📥 – very fast memory inside the CPU.  
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** 🧠 – executes instructions and manages operations.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** 🎨 – specialized for graphics and parallel tasks.  
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** 📀 – mechanical storage device using spinning platters.  
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)** ⚡ – faster, no moving parts.  
- **Flash Memory** 🔋 – removable storage (USB, SD card).  
- **Storage Hierarchy** 🏗️ – cache → RAM → storage; speed vs capacity.  
- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** 🧪 – diagnostic at system startup.  
- **BIOS/UEFI** ⚙️ – low-level firmware that initializes hardware.  
- **File System** 📂 – method to organize and manage files.  
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)** 🔌 – converts electricity for the system.  
- **Buses** 🔀 – communication pathways (data, address, control).  
- **Peripherals** 🖱️⌨️🖨️ – external devices connected to a computer.

## 💡 Insights
- Hardware forms the **foundation of IT** – understanding it is key to troubleshooting.  
- The **CPU, RAM, and storage** must be balanced for good performance.  
- **Boot issues** often point to POST or BIOS/UEFI problems.  
- Knowledge of **file systems** and **peripherals** is crucial in IT Support.
