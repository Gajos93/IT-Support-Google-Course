# 🖥️ Course 1 – Module 2: Hardware

## 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Hardware Basics** 🧩 – input, output, storage, and processing devices.  
- **Binary System** 🔢 – all computer data and instructions are represented as 0s and 1s.  
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** ⚙️ – the "brain" of the computer that executes instructions.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** 🎨 – accelerates graphics rendering and parallel tasks.  
- **Motherboard** 🔗 – the main circuit board that connects CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.  
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ⚡ – volatile, temporary memory for active processes.  
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** 💾 – permanent memory storing essential instructions (e.g., BIOS).  
- **Storage Types** 💽:  
  - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** 📀 – mechanical, larger capacity but slower.  
  - **SSD (Solid-State Drive)** ⚡ – no moving parts, faster and more reliable.  
  - **Flash Memory** 🔋 – used in USB drives and SD cards.

## 📝 Important Notes
- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** 🧪 – diagnostic test when powering on a computer.  
- **BIOS/UEFI** ⚙️ – firmware that initializes hardware and starts the boot process.  
- **Boot Process Order** 🚀 – POST → BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader → Operating System.  
- **Power Supply (PSU)** 🔌 – converts AC electricity into regulated DC for the computer.  
- **File Systems** 📂 – organize and manage files into directories (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4).  
- **Peripherals** 🖱️⌨️🖨️ – external devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer.

## 📚 Extended Hardware Knowledge
- **Cache Memory** ⚡ – very fast memory inside the CPU, bridges the gap between CPU and RAM.  
- **Buses** 🔀 – data highways that transfer signals between CPU, RAM, and peripherals.  
  - **Data Bus** 📡 – moves actual data.  
  - **Address Bus** 🗺️ – specifies memory locations.  
  - **Control Bus** 🎛️ – sends control signals (read/write).  
- **Expansion Slots (PCIe)** 🧩 – allow adding extra cards (e.g., graphics, network, sound).  
- **Cooling Systems** ❄️ – fans, heat sinks, liquid cooling protect components from overheating.  
- **Storage Hierarchy** 🏗️ – CPU cache → RAM → SSD/HDD → external storage. The closer to CPU, the faster but smaller.

## 💡 Insights
- Hardware = **foundation of IT** 🏗️ – understanding it helps in troubleshooting.  
- The **boot process** is critical: if it fails, OS never loads.  
- Performance depends on **balance** ⚖️ – CPU, RAM, storage speed, and GPU must complement each other.
