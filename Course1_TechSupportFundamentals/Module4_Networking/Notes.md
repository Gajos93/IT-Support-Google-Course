# 🌐 Module 4: Networking – Notes

## 🔌 What is Networking?
- **Networking** is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.  
- Two main types of networks:  
  - 🏠 **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small, local (e.g., office, home).  
  - 🌍 **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large, global (e.g., the Internet).

## 📘 Key Concepts
- 🔢 **IP Address:** Unique identifier for each device on a network.  
  - 📄 **IPv4:** 32-bit, written as 4 numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1).  
  - 🆕 **IPv6:** 128-bit, created because IPv4 addresses are limited.  
- 🖥️ **MAC Address:** Hardware address of a network card (unique to device).  
- ➗ **Subnetting:** Dividing networks into smaller parts for better management.  
- 🌐 **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names (google.com) into IP addresses.  
- 🎛️ **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.  
- 🔄 **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Converts private IPs into public ones, used by routers.

## 📡 Protocols
- 📦 **TCP/IP:** The main communication protocol of the Internet.  
- ⚡ **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Faster but less reliable (used in streaming, gaming).  
- 🌍 **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for browsing websites.  
- 📂 **FTP:** File Transfer Protocol.  
- ✉️ **SMTP/IMAP/POP3:** Email protocols.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Commands
- 🏓 **ping:** Test connectivity with another device.  
- 🧭 **tracert / traceroute:** Show the path packets take to a destination.  
- 🔎 **nslookup:** Check DNS resolution.  
- ⚙️ **ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Linux):** Show network configuration.  
- 📊 **netstat:** Display active connections and ports.

## 🚧 Common Issues & Troubleshooting
1. ❌ **No Internet connection** → Check cables, Wi-Fi, adapter status.  
2. ⚠️ **Wrong IP configuration** → Release/renew IP (via DHCP).  
3. 🌀 **DNS errors** → Use nslookup, try changing DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8).  
4. 🐢 **Slow network** → Check bandwidth, interference, number of devices.

## ✅ Summary
Networking is about how devices talk to each other, how IPs and DNS work, and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong.
