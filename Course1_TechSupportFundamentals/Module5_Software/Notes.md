# 💾 Course 1 – Module 5: Software

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what software is and how it differs from hardware.  
- Identify types of software: system, application, firmware.  
- Learn basics of programming, scripting, and automation.  
- Recognize the role of version control and software management.

## 📝 Notes

### 🔹 What is Software?
- **Software** 💿 – the set of instructions that tells hardware what to do.  
- Unlike **hardware** (physical parts), software is **intangible**.  
- Categories of software:  
  - **System Software** 🧰 – keeps the computer running (OS, utilities, drivers).  
  - **Application Software** 📱 – tools users interact with directly (word processors, browsers).  
  - **Firmware** 🧬 – built-in software stored in hardware (e.g., BIOS in ROM).

### 🔹 Programming & Languages
- **Programming** 👨‍💻 – writing instructions for computers.  
- **Programming Languages** 🗣️ – special languages to create software (e.g., Python, C, Java).  
- **Coding** ✍️ – the act of writing instructions in a language.  

#### Types of languages
- **Compiled Languages** 🏗️ – translated by a compiler into machine code before execution.  
  - Examples: C, C++, Go.  
  - Pros: fast performance, optimized.  
- **Interpreted Languages** 🎧 – executed line by line by an interpreter.  
  - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Bash.  
  - Pros: easier to test, more flexible.  
- **Assembly Language** 🔧 – low-level, closer to hardware instructions.

### 🔹 Scripting & Automation
- **Scripts** ▶️ – short programs, often used for system tasks and automation.  
- **Scripting** 🧪 – coding in scripting languages (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, Python).  
- **Automation** 🤖 – reducing human effort by making processes run automatically.  
- Common in IT Support: log collection, user account creation, system backups.

### 🔹 Software Lifecycle
- **Software Bugs** 🐛 – errors that cause unexpected behavior.  
- **Software Management** 🗂️ – installing, updating, patching, and tracking software.  
- **Copyright** ©️ – protects software as original creative work.  

---

### 🔹 Collaboration & Version Control
- **Git** 🌿 – version control system for tracking changes in code and documents.  
- Allows multiple people to work on the same files safely.  
- Used not only by developers but also by IT teams for config scripts, documentation, and runbooks.  
- **`.exe` Files** 💼 – executable files in Windows (binary programs).

## 💡 Insights
- Software builds on hardware: **firmware → system software → applications**.  
- Learning **compiled vs interpreted** differences helps understand performance and compatibility.  
- **Scripting + automation** are critical skills in IT support to speed up work and reduce errors.  
- **Version control (Git)** is essential for teamwork, rollback, and tracking changes.
