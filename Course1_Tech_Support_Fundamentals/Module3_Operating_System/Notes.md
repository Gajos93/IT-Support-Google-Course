# 💻 Course 1 – Module 3: Operating Systems

## 📝 Notes

### 🔹 What is an Operating System?
- **Operating System (OS)** 🖥️ – software that manages hardware and software resources, and provides an interface for the user.  
- Acts as a bridge between **hardware** and **applications**.  

---

### 🔹 The Kernel
- **Kernel** 🧠 – the core of the OS.  
- Responsibilities:  
  - **Process Management** 🔄 – schedules and runs programs.  
  - **Memory Management** 📦 – allocates RAM and ensures efficiency.  
  - **Device Communication** 🎛️ – manages input/output with drivers.  
  - **File System Management** 📂 – handles files and directories.  

---

### 🔹 User Interfaces
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** 🖱️ – windows, icons, and menus for easy interaction.  
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** 💻 – text-based commands interpreted by a shell.  
- **Shell** 🐚 – program that interprets commands and passes them to the OS.  

---

### 🔹 Virtualization
- **Virtualization Software** 🧩 (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) – allows multiple OS environments on one physical machine.  
- **Virtual Machine (VM)** 💻 – simulated computer running inside a host system.  
- **Hypervisor** ⚙️ – software layer that creates and manages VMs (Type 1 = bare metal, Type 2 = hosted).  

---

### 🔹 Command-Line Tools
- **PowerShell** 🔷 – advanced shell for Windows with scripting capabilities.  
- **Bash** 🐧 – common Linux/Unix shell.  
- **CLI skills** are essential in IT Support for troubleshooting, automation, and advanced configuration.  

---

### 🔹 Other Key Concepts
- **Networking Basics** 🌐  
  - **IP Address** 🔢 – unique device identifier in a network.  
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)** 📖 – resolves domain names into IP addresses.  
  - **ICMP (ping)** 🏓 – protocol for connectivity testing.  

- **System Logs** 📜 – record system events, useful for troubleshooting and auditing.  
- **User Management** 👥 – creating/deleting accounts, managing permissions.  
- **OS Families** 🐧🪟🍏 – Linux, Windows, and macOS differ in design but share core functions.

## 📖 Key Terms

- **Operating System (OS)** 🖥️ – software that manages hardware, software, and user interaction.  
- **Kernel** 🧠 – the OS core that manages processes, memory, and hardware communication.  
- **Process Management** 🔄 – scheduling and executing programs.  
- **Memory Management** 📦 – allocating and optimizing RAM usage.  
- **File System Management** 📂 – handling storage, directories, and permissions.  
- **User Interface** 🖱️⌨️ – how users interact with the OS (GUI or CLI).  
- **Shell** 🐚 – program interpreting text commands (e.g., Bash, PowerShell).  
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** 💻 – text-based user interface.  
- **PowerShell** 🔷 – Microsoft’s advanced shell for Windows.  
- **Bash** 🐧 – common Linux shell.  
- **Virtualization** 🧩 – running multiple OS environments on one physical machine.  
- **Virtual Machine (VM)** 💻 – a simulated computer.  
- **Hypervisor** ⚙️ – software layer managing VMs.  
- **System Logs** 📜 – files recording system events.  
- **User Management** 👥 – creating, deleting, and managing accounts and permissions.  
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** 🏓 – network protocol used by `ping`.  
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** 📖 – translates domain names to IP addresses.

## 💡 Insights
- The **kernel** is the heart of the OS – it makes all core operations possible.  
- **Virtualization** is essential for labs, testing, and enterprise environments.  
- **CLI proficiency** gives IT professionals speed and flexibility beyond the GUI.  
- IT Support requires knowledge across different OS families (Windows, Linux, macOS).
