# 💾 Course 1 – Module 5: Software

## 📝 Notes

### 🔹 What is Software?
- **Software** 💿 – the intangible instructions that tell hardware what to do.  
- It contrasts with **hardware** 🧩 (physical parts).  
- Categories of software:  
  - **System Software** 🧰 – keeps the computer running (OS, utilities, drivers).  
  - **Application Software** 📱 – programs used by end users (e.g., text editors, browsers, graphics tools).  
  - **Firmware** 🧬 – permanent software stored in hardware components (e.g., BIOS in ROM).

### 🔹 Programming Fundamentals
- **Programming** 👨‍💻 – writing instructions that computers can execute.  
- **Programming Languages** 🗣️ – structured languages (Python, C, Java) used to write code.  
- **Coding** ✍️ – the act of translating logic into a programming language.  

#### Compiled vs Interpreted
- **Compiled Languages** 🏗️ – code is converted into machine code by a compiler before execution.  
  - Examples: C, C++.  
  - Pros: fast performance, optimized.  
- **Interpreted Languages** 🎧 – code is translated line by line by an interpreter.  
  - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Bash.  
  - Pros: easier testing, flexibility.  
- **Assembly Language** 🔧 – very low-level, human-readable instructions close to machine code.

### 🔹 Scripting & Automation
- **Script** ▶️ – small program executed by an interpreter.  
- **Scripting** 🧪 – writing scripts in interpreted languages.  
- **Automation** 🤖 – reducing human effort by automating repetitive tasks.  
- Common in IT Support: backups, account management, log collection.  

---

### 🔹 Software Development & Management
- **Software Bugs** 🐛 – errors that cause incorrect or unexpected behavior.  
- **Software Management** 🗂️ – installation, updates, patching, and project/task tools.  
- **Copyright** ©️ – legal protection for original software works.  

---

### 🔹 Collaboration & Version Control
- **Git** 🌿 – distributed version control system for tracking and managing changes.  
- Useful for developers and IT teams to manage scripts, configs, and documentation.  
- **`.exe` Files** 💼 – Windows executable file format.

## 📖 Key Terms

- **Software** 💿 – programs and instructions for hardware.  
- **System Software** 🧰 – keeps the system running (OS, utilities).  
- **Application Software** 📱 – user-facing programs.  
- **Firmware** 🧬 – software permanently embedded in hardware.  
- **Programming** 👨‍💻 – writing instructions for a computer.  
- **Programming Language** 🗣️ – language used to write software.  
- **Coding** ✍️ – the process of writing code.  
- **Compiled Language** 🏗️ – requires compilation into machine code before execution.  
- **Interpreted Language** 🎧 – executed line by line by an interpreter.  
- **Assembly Language** 🔧 – low-level code close to machine instructions.  
- **Script** ▶️ – small program run by an interpreter.  
- **Scripting** 🧪 – coding in scripting languages.  
- **Automation** 🤖 – making processes run automatically.  
- **Software Bug** 🐛 – error or flaw in code.  
- **Software Management** 🗂️ – maintaining and tracking software.  
- **Copyright** ©️ – legal protection for original works.  
- **`.exe` File** 💼 – executable file format in Windows.  
- **Git** 🌿 – version control system for tracking changes.

## 💡 Insights
- Software forms a layered stack: **firmware → system software → applications**.  
- Understanding the difference between **compiled and interpreted languages** is crucial for troubleshooting.  
- **Automation and scripting** save time and reduce errors in IT Support.  
- **Version control systems** like Git are essential for teamwork, rollback, and safe configuration management.
