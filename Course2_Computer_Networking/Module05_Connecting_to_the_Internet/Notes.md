# 🌍 Course 2 – Module 5: Connecting to the Internet

## 🧭 Overview
This module explains **how individual devices, networks, and organizations connect to the Internet**, the world’s largest interconnected network.

## 🧩 The Internet: A Network of Networks
- The **Internet** is a massive global system of **interconnected autonomous networks (AS)**.  
- Each network is managed independently but uses **standardized protocols** (TCP/IP) to communicate.  
- Communication between these networks is made possible through **routers**, **ISPs**, and **exchange points**.

### 🌐 Key Components:
- **End devices** 💻 (clients, servers, mobile phones) – generate and receive traffic.  
- **Local networks (LANs)** 🏠 – home or corporate internal networks.  
- **Routers and switches** 🔁 – interconnect and forward traffic.  
- **ISPs (Internet Service Providers)** 🏢 – provide access to the global Internet.  
- **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)** ⚙️ – physical locations where networks exchange traffic directly.  
- **Backbone networks** 🌎 – high-capacity connections linking large ISPs and data centers worldwide.

## 🛰️ Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

### 🔹 What Is an ISP?
An **Internet Service Provider** is an organization that offers Internet access and related services.  
ISPs form a hierarchy and interconnect through **peering** and **transit agreements**.

### 🔹 ISP Tiers Explained
| Tier | Description | Example Providers |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** 🌐 | Large global networks that own infrastructure and exchange traffic freely with other Tier 1s (no payment). | Level 3, AT&T, Tata Communications |
| **Tier 2** 🏢 | Regional ISPs that pay Tier 1s for upstream access and peer with other Tier 2s. | Comcast, Vodafone, Orange |
| **Tier 3** 🏠 | Local ISPs providing Internet to homes and businesses. They pay Tier 2 ISPs for connectivity. | Local cable/fiber ISPs |

### 🔹 ISP Responsibilities
- Provide **last-mile connectivity** to homes and businesses.  
- Manage **IP address allocation** (via DHCP or static configuration).  
- Offer **DNS and email hosting** services.  
- Maintain **network infrastructure** (routers, links, data centers).  
- Handle **peering and routing** with other networks.

## 🔄 Routing and Internet Infrastructure

### 🔹 The Role of Routers
Routers forward data between networks using **IP addressing** and **routing tables**.  
Each packet is forwarded hop-by-hop until it reaches its destination.

### 🔹 Autonomous Systems (AS)
- Each ISP or large organization operates as an **Autonomous System** with a unique **ASN (Autonomous System Number)** assigned by **IANA** or regional registries (RIPE, ARIN, APNIC).  
- Routers inside an AS use **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)** like OSPF or EIGRP.  
- Routers between ASes use **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)**, primarily **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.  

### 🔹 BGP – The Backbone of the Internet
- **BGP** is the routing protocol that enables data exchange between Autonomous Systems.  
- Each BGP router advertises the networks it can reach.  
- Peering relationships define how traffic flows between ISPs:
  - **Private peering** – direct link between two ISPs.  
  - **Public peering** – through IXPs, where many ISPs interconnect.

## ⚙️ How Data Travels Across the Internet

### 🧭 The Path of a Packet
When you visit `www.example.com`:
1. Your computer uses **DNS** to find the IP address of the site.  
2. The browser sends a request through the **local router (gateway)**.  
3. The packet travels via your **ISP’s network**.  
4. It passes through multiple **routers and autonomous systems**.  
5. The packet finally reaches the **destination server**.  
6. The server’s response follows the same route (or a different one) back to you.

### 🔹 Packet Switching
- Internet communication uses **packet switching**, not circuit switching.  
- Data is split into packets, each taking potentially different routes.  
- Routers forward packets based on the **best available path** using routing protocols.

## 🔌 Internet Connection Types

### 🏠 Home and Small Business Connections
| Connection Type | Description | Typical Speed | Medium |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Dial-Up** ☎️ | Legacy technology using phone lines. Very slow (up to 56 Kbps). | Copper |
| **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)** ⚙️ | Uses existing telephone infrastructure with dedicated frequency bands. | 1–100 Mbps | Copper |
| **Cable Broadband** 📺 | Uses coaxial cables shared among users in an area. | 50–1000 Mbps | Coaxial |
| **Fiber Optic** 💡 | Uses glass fiber cables; offers very high speeds and reliability. | 100 Mbps–10 Gbps | Fiber |
| **Satellite Internet** 🛰️ | Ideal for remote locations; higher latency due to distance. | 25–250 Mbps | Wireless |
| **Cellular / Mobile Data** 📱 | 4G/5G mobile networks providing Internet access. | 10 Mbps–1 Gbps | Wireless |

---

### 🏢 Enterprise and Data Center Connections
- **Dedicated leased lines** – symmetric, high-speed connections for businesses.  
- **Metro Ethernet** – fiber-based regional networking.  
- **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)** – used for secure, managed WANs.  
- **VPN over Internet** – secure tunnels between offices using encryption.

## 🧠 Internet Governance and Standards

### 🔹 Key Organizations
| Organization | Responsibility |
|---------------|----------------|
| **IANA** | Allocates IP addresses and AS numbers globally. |
| **ICANN** | Oversees domain name management and DNS root servers. |
| **IEEE** | Develops physical and data link standards (Ethernet, Wi-Fi). |
