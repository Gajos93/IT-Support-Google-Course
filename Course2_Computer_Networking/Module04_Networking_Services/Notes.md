# 🌐 Course 2 – Module 4: Networking Services

## 🧭 Overview
The **Networking Services** module focuses on key technologies that make modern networks functional and user-friendly.  
These services operate on the **upper layers** of the networking model, connecting devices, assigning addresses, translating names, and enabling secure communication across the Internet.

### 🧩 Core Networking Services
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** 🌍 – translates domain names into IP addresses.  
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** 🧩 – automatically assigns IP configurations to devices.  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** 🔄 – translates private IPs to public IPs.  
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** 🔐 – creates secure, encrypted tunnels over public networks.  
- **Proxy Services** 🧱 – intermediaries that manage, filter, or cache network traffic.  

Together, these services form the **foundation of real-world networking**, connecting billions of devices globally.

## 🌍 DNS – Domain Name System

### 🔹 Purpose
- Converts **human-friendly domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into **machine-friendly IP addresses** (`142.250.72.14`).  
- Without DNS, users would need to remember long numeric IPs for every website.  

---

### 🔹 How DNS Works
When you type a domain name in your browser:

1. 🧠 **Local Resolver Cache** – checks if the IP is already stored locally.  
2. 🌐 **DNS Query** – if not found, your system sends a query to a configured DNS resolver (often your ISP or router).  
3. 🏗️ **Root Name Server** – directs the query to the correct TLD server (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).  
4. 🏢 **TLD Server** – points to the **authoritative name server** for the domain.  
5. 🧭 **Authoritative Server** – returns the actual IP address.  
6. 💾 **Caching** – the IP is stored locally for faster access next time.

This hierarchical structure ensures DNS can scale globally while remaining efficient.

### 🔹 DNS Record Types
| Record Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **A** | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address | `example.com → 93.184.216.34` |
| **AAAA** | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address | `example.com → 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946` |
| **CNAME** | Canonical name (alias) for another record | `mail.example.com → example.com` |
| **MX** | Mail exchange server for email delivery | `MX → mail.example.com` |
| **TXT** | Stores text-based data (SPF, DKIM, etc.) | SPF record for anti-spam |
| **NS** | Identifies the authoritative name servers | `ns1.example.com` |
| **SOA** | Start of Authority – zone management data | Contains admin info, versioning |

---

### 🔹 DNS Query Types
- **Recursive query** 🔄 – client asks the resolver to do *all* the work to find the IP.  
- **Iterative query** 🔁 – the resolver may respond with a referral to another server.  
- **Reverse DNS lookup** 🔙 – maps IP → domain name (used in diagnostics, email validation).  

---

### 🔹 DNS Zones & Delegation
- The DNS namespace is split into **zones**, each managed by specific authoritative servers.  
- Example:  
  - `example.com` is managed by one zone.  
  - `sub.example.com` could be delegated to another zone.  
- Each zone contains a **zone file** with resource records.  

---

### 🔹 DNS and Transport Protocols
- **UDP (Port 53)** – used for most DNS queries; fast, lightweight.  
- **TCP (Port 53)** – used for zone transfers or larger responses (>512 bytes).  
- **DNS Caching** ⏱️ – reduces latency and network load but can delay updates (TTL – time to live).

---

## 🧩 DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

### 🔹 Purpose
DHCP automates the process of assigning **IP addresses** and other network settings (subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers) to clients.  
This eliminates the need for manual configuration and reduces human error.

---

### 🔹 The DORA Process 🚀
DHCP communication follows four key steps:

1. **Discover** 🔍 – The client broadcasts a request for an IP address.  
2. **Offer** 📦 – The DHCP server replies with an available address and configuration.  
3. **Request** 📥 – The client asks to use that specific IP.  
4. **Acknowledge** ✅ – The server confirms the lease and finalizes the assignment.  

🕒 Each address is assigned with a **lease time** (duration of validity).  
Before expiration, the client must **renew** or **release** its lease.

---

### 🔹 DHCP Options
Common parameters included in DHCP messages:
- **Option 1** – Subnet mask  
- **Option 3** – Default gateway  
- **Option 6** – DNS servers  
- **Option 51** – Lease duration  
- **Option 53** – Message type (Discover, Offer, etc.)

---

### 🔹 DHCP Security Considerations 🔒
- **Rogue DHCP servers** can cause serious network disruptions.  
- Solutions:
  - DHCP Snooping (on switches).  
  - Trusted network configurations.  

---

## 🔄 NAT – Network Address Translation

### 🔹 Purpose
NAT allows multiple private devices to **share a single public IP** when accessing the Internet.  
It rewrites source IP addresses in outgoing packets and maintains a **translation table**.

---

### 🔹 How NAT Works
1. A device in a LAN (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) sends a packet to the Internet.  
2. The router replaces the source IP with its **public IP** (e.g., `203.0.113.5`).  
3. It records the mapping in the **NAT table**.  
4. When the reply arrives, the router consults its table and forwards it back to the original host.

---

### 🔹 Types of NAT
| Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Static NAT** | One-to-one mapping between private and public IPs | Hosting internal servers |
| **Dynamic NAT** | Maps to a pool of public IPs dynamically | Large networks with many users |
| **PAT (Port Address Translation)** | Many-to-one mapping using port numbers | Home routers, small offices |

---

### 🔹 NAT Features
- Provides **address conservation** for IPv4.  
- Adds a layer of **basic security** (hides internal network structure).  
- **Port Forwarding** 🛠️ – allows external users to access internal services (e.g., web server on port 80).  

---

### 🔹 NAT Limitations ⚠️
- Breaks **end-to-end connectivity** (problems with P2P, VoIP).  
- Doesn’t scale well for modern applications → one reason for **IPv6 adoption**.  

---

## 🔐 VPN – Virtual Private Network

### 🔹 What is a VPN?
A **VPN** extends a private network across a public network (like the Internet).  
It enables users to securely send and receive data as if they were directly connected to a private LAN.

---

### 🔹 How VPNs Work
- VPNs use **encryption and tunneling** to protect data between two endpoints.  
- Data packets are encapsulated inside other packets, making them unreadable to outsiders.  
- Common encryption protocols:
  - **IPsec** 🔒 – Network-layer security for site-to-site VPNs.  
  - **SSL/TLS** 🔑 – Transport-layer encryption for remote access VPNs.  
  - **OpenVPN / WireGuard** 🧩 – popular software-based VPN implementations.  

---

### 🔹 Types of VPNs
| Type | Description | Example Use |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Remote Access VPN** | Connects remote users to internal resources | Employees working from home |
| **Site-to-Site VPN** | Connects entire networks securely over the Internet | Branch offices |
| **Client-to-Server VPN** | Individual connection between a device and server | Mobile VPN apps |

---

### 🔹 VPN Advantages
- Data confidentiality and integrity.  
- Protection against eavesdropping.  
- Secure remote work.  
- Bypassing geographic restrictions (in consumer VPNs).

---

## 🧱 Proxy Services

### 🔹 What Is a Proxy?
A **proxy server** acts as a **middleman** between a client and another server.  
It can manage, filter, or cache traffic depending on configuration.

---

### 🔹 Types of Proxy Servers
| Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Forward Proxy** | Sits between user and Internet, forwarding requests | Corporate firewalls, content filters |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Sits in front of web servers, managing inbound traffic | Load balancing, caching, SSL offload |
| **Transparent Proxy** | Intercepts requests without user configuration | ISP caching, monitoring |

---

### 🔹 Benefits of Proxy Services
- 🧠 **Caching** – stores frequently accessed content for faster delivery.  
- 🔒 **Anonymity & Security** – hides user IPs and blocks malicious sites.  
- ⚙️ **Load Balancing** – distributes traffic across multiple servers.  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Control** – tracks usage and enforces policies.  

---

## 📖 Key Terms
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** 🌍 – translates domain names into IP addresses.  
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** 🧩 – assigns IP settings automatically.  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** 🔄 – maps private IPs to public ones.  
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** 🔢 – multiple devices share one public IP using unique ports.  
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** 🔐 – encrypted connection across public networks.
