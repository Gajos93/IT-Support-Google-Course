# 📦 Course 2 – Module 3: The Transport and Application Layers

## 🧭 Overview
This module explains how the **Transport Layer** and **Application Layer** of the networking model work together to ensure that data is reliably delivered to the correct applications running on end systems.

- The **Transport Layer (Layer 4 in OSI, Layer 3 in TCP/IP)**:  
  - Controls **how data is transferred** between hosts.  
  - Ensures reliability, flow control, and segmentation.

- The **Application Layer (Layer 7 in OSI, Layer 5 in TCP/IP)**:  
  - Provides **interfaces and protocols** that allow software and users to communicate over a network.  
  - Examples: HTTP, DNS, SMTP, DHCP, etc.

Together, these layers ensure that users can browse the web, send email, stream media, and connect securely to services across the world.

## ⚙️ The Transport Layer

### 🔹 Main Responsibilities
1. **Segmentation & Reassembly** 🧩  
   - Large chunks of data are split into **segments** before transmission.  
   - Each segment is numbered (sequence numbers) to ensure correct reassembly.

2. **Connection Management** 🔄  
   - Establishes, maintains, and terminates logical connections between hosts.

3. **Error Detection & Correction** 🧮  
   - Uses checksums to detect corrupted data and request retransmission.

4. **Flow Control** 🚦  
   - Prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.

5. **Multiplexing / Demultiplexing** 🔢  
   - Multiple applications can use the network simultaneously via **ports**.

### 🔹 TCP vs UDP
The two major Transport Layer protocols are **TCP** and **UDP**.  

| Feature | **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) | **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Type | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable – acknowledgments, retransmissions | Unreliable – no delivery confirmation |
| Order | Guarantees correct order (sequence numbers) | No guarantee of order |
| Speed | Slower due to overhead | Faster, less overhead |
| Error Handling | Error detection & recovery | Basic checksum only |
| Header Size | 20–60 bytes | 8 bytes |
| Use Cases | Web, email, file transfer | Streaming, VoIP, DNS, gaming |

---

### 🔹 The TCP Three-Way Handshake 🤝
Establishing a connection in TCP involves **synchronizing both ends** before data transfer:

1. **SYN** – The client sends a synchronize (SYN) request to the server.  
2. **SYN-ACK** – The server acknowledges and responds with its own SYN.  
3. **ACK** – The client confirms the connection is established.

This ensures both devices are ready for reliable communication.  
When the session ends, a **four-step FIN/ACK process** gracefully closes it.

---

### 🔹 TCP Segmentation & Acknowledgments
- TCP divides application data into segments.  
- Each segment includes:  
  - **Source and Destination Ports**  
  - **Sequence and Acknowledgment numbers**  
  - **Window size** (for flow control)  
  - **Checksum** (for error detection)
- The receiver sends **ACKs (acknowledgments)** confirming successful receipt.

If an ACK isn’t received, the sender retransmits the missing segment.

---

### 🔹 Flow Control & Congestion Control
- **Flow Control** 🚦:  
  - Managed via TCP’s **sliding window**.  
  - The receiver advertises how much data it can handle.  
  - The sender adjusts its transmission rate accordingly.  

- **Congestion Control** 🌊:  
  - Prevents overloading the network.  
  - TCP algorithms like **Slow Start**, **Congestion Avoidance**, and **Fast Recovery** adjust the sending rate based on network feedback.

---

### 🔹 UDP – Fast but Unreliable ⚡
- UDP sends **datagrams** without establishing a session.  
- There are **no acknowledgments, sequence numbers, or flow control**.  
- Ideal for:
  - **Streaming media (YouTube, Netflix)**  
  - **Real-time voice/video (VoIP)**  
  - **Online gaming**  
  - **DNS lookups**  

Even though UDP is "unreliable," it’s faster and sufficient for time-sensitive applications where retransmission isn’t practical.

---

### 🔹 Ports and Multiplexing
- Each Transport Layer protocol uses **port numbers** to identify the application sending/receiving data.  
- A **socket** = IP address + Port number → uniquely identifies each connection.  

**Port number ranges:**
- **0–1023**: Well-known ports (HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.)  
- **1024–49151**: Registered ports for specific services.  
- **49152–65535**: Dynamic/Private (used temporarily by clients).

**Examples:**

| Service | Protocol | Port | Description |
|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| HTTP | TCP | 80 | Web traffic |
| HTTPS | TCP | 443 | Encrypted web traffic |
| FTP | TCP | 21 | File transfer |
| SSH | TCP | 22 | Secure remote access |
| SMTP | TCP | 25 | Send email |
| POP3 | TCP | 110 | Receive email |
| IMAP | TCP | 143 | Manage mailboxes |
| DNS | UDP/TCP | 53 | Domain name resolution |
| DHCP | UDP | 67/68 | Automatic IP assignment |
| SNMP | UDP | 161 | Network management |

## 🌐 The Application Layer

### 🔹 Overview
The **Application Layer** provides the interface between the user’s software and the network.  
Applications use **standardized protocols** to send/receive data via the Transport Layer.

Key responsibilities:
- Data formatting (presentation).  
- Application-specific communication.  
- User authentication and encryption.  
- Request/response communication models (client-server).  

---

### 🔹 Common Application Layer Protocols
| Protocol | Description | Port | Transport |
|-----------|--------------|------|------------|
| **HTTP** 🌐 | Web browsing (hypertext transfer) | 80 | TCP |
| **HTTPS** 🔒 | Secure HTTP (SSL/TLS encryption) | 443 | TCP |
| **FTP** 💾 | File transfer | 21 | TCP |
| **SSH** 🔐 | Secure remote command-line access | 22 | TCP |
| **SMTP** ✉️ | Sending email | 25 | TCP |
| **POP3** 📥 | Retrieving email (simple) | 110 | TCP |
| **IMAP** 📫 | Advanced email retrieval (synchronization) | 143 | TCP |
| **DNS** 🌍 | Domain name → IP resolution | 53 | UDP/TCP |
| **DHCP** 🧩 | Automatic IP configuration | 67/68 | UDP |
| **SNMP** 🧠 | Device management and monitoring | 161 | UDP |

---

### 🔹 DNS – Domain Name System
- Translates human-readable names into IP addresses.  
- Hierarchical system:  
  1. **Root servers** (.)  
  2. **TLD servers** (.com, .org, .net)  
  3. **Authoritative servers** (e.g., google.com)  
- **Resolvers** (usually at ISPs) handle lookups for clients.  
- Uses caching to improve speed.  
- Works primarily over **UDP port 53**, but uses TCP for larger transfers (zone transfers).

---

### 🔹 DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Automates the assignment of network configurations:  
  - IP address  
  - Subnet mask  
  - Default gateway  
  - DNS servers  

**DORA process**:  
1. **Discover** – client broadcasts a request.  
2. **Offer** – DHCP server responds with an IP offer.  
3. **Request** – client requests that specific IP.  
4. **Acknowledge** – server confirms the lease.

DHCP prevents IP conflicts and simplifies large-scale device management.

---

### 🔹 NAT – Network Address Translation
- Operates between Network and Transport layers.  
- Maps **private IPs → public IPs**, allowing multiple devices to share one Internet connection.  
- Maintains a **translation table** mapping internal addresses and ports to external ones.  

**Types of NAT:**
1. **Static NAT** – one-to-one mapping.  
2. **Dynamic NAT** – maps to available IPs from a pool.  
3. **PAT (Port Address Translation)** – many-to-one using unique ports (most common).  

---

### 🔹 Firewalls & Filtering
- **Firewalls** protect networks by filtering traffic based on:
  - IP addresses
  - Port numbers
  - Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Application signatures
- Types of firewalls:
  - **Packet-filtering firewall** (checks headers)
  - **Stateful inspection firewall** (tracks connections)
  - **Application-layer firewall** (deep packet inspection)

---

### 🔹 Socket Connections
- A **socket** = IP + Port (e.g., `192.168.1.10:443`).  
- Each connection between client and server is represented by a unique socket pair:
  - Source IP:Port ↔ Destination IP:Port  
- Enables multiple concurrent sessions for different apps or users.
