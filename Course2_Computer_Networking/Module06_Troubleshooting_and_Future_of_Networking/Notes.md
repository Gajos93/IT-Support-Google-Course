## 🧰 Network Troubleshooting Fundamentals

### 🔹 What Is Troubleshooting?
**Troubleshooting** is the process of **identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems** in a network.  
The goal is to restore normal functionality as efficiently as possible.

Troubleshooting combines:
- Technical knowledge 🧠  
- Logical reasoning 🔍  
- Systematic testing 🧪  
- Communication and documentation skills 🗒️

### 🔹 The Troubleshooting Process
A structured approach helps prevent wasted time and misdiagnosis.  

#### 🪜 6 Classic Steps:
1. **Identify the problem** 🔎  
   - Gather information from users and logs.  
   - Determine symptoms: “Can’t access the Internet” vs. “Slow connection.”  

2. **Establish a theory of probable cause** 💭  
   - Start with the simplest explanation (cable unplugged, misconfiguration).  
   - Use logic to narrow down potential causes.  

3. **Test the theory** 🧪  
   - Try to reproduce the issue.  
   - Use network tools (ping, traceroute, nslookup).  

4. **Establish a plan of action** 🗺️  
   - Choose the most effective fix with minimal disruption.  

5. **Implement the solution** 🧰  
   - Apply configuration changes, replace hardware, or restart services.  

6. **Verify full system functionality and document** 📋  
   - Ensure everything works correctly.  
   - Record what was done for future reference.

### 🔹 The Divide and Conquer Method
Instead of starting from one end of the network, you can test **from the middle outward**:
- If ping to the router works but not to the Internet ➜ the problem is external.  
- If ping to the router fails ➜ problem is inside the LAN.

### 🔹 Common Problem Areas
| Layer | Common Issues | Examples |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Physical (Layer 1)** | Cables, connectors, power, Wi-Fi signal | Loose cable, dead NIC, bad switch port |
| **Data Link (Layer 2)** | MAC conflicts, VLAN misconfigurations | Wrong VLAN tag, switch loop |
| **Network (Layer 3)** | IP addressing, routing issues | Incorrect gateway, bad subnet mask |
| **Transport (Layer 4)** | Port blocking, TCP/UDP errors | Firewall misconfiguration |
| **Application (Layer 7)** | DNS, email, HTTP issues | Misconfigured DNS server, proxy error |

### 🔹 Hardware & Software Tools
- **Cable testers / multimeters** 🧵 – verify physical integrity.  
- **Network analyzers (Wireshark)** 🧪 – capture and inspect packets.  
- **Port scanners (nmap)** 🔎 – check for open or vulnerable ports.  
- **Network performance tools (iperf)** ⚡ – test throughput and latency.  
- **Syslog servers** 🗂️ – collect device logs for correlation.

## 🧩 Diagnosing Network Symptoms

### 🔹 No Connectivity
Possible causes:
- Disconnected or damaged cables.  
- Faulty network adapter.  
- Incorrect IP or gateway configuration.  
- DHCP server down.  
- Router or switch failure.  

**Fix:**  
Check link lights, run `ipconfig`, verify gateway, and test ping step-by-step.

---

### 🔹 Slow or Intermittent Connection
Possible causes:
- Network congestion or high latency.  
- Duplex mismatch (half/full).  
- Faulty cabling or interference.  
- High CPU usage on a router or switch.  

**Fix:**  
Monitor traffic with `netstat`, check bandwidth usage, and verify interface statistics.

---

### 🔹 DNS Problems
Symptoms:
- You can ping an IP but not a hostname.  
**Fix:**  
- Test DNS resolution using `nslookup`.  
- Verify correct DNS servers in network settings.  
- Flush DNS cache (`ipconfig /flushdns`).

---

### 🔹 IP Conflicts
Two devices using the same IP cause instability and drops.  
**Fix:**  
- Check ARP table.  
- Release/renew IP with `ipconfig /release` → `ipconfig /renew`.  
- Use DHCP reservations for static assignments.

---

### 🔹 Wireless Connectivity Issues
Possible causes:
- Weak signal or interference.  
- Wrong SSID or passphrase.  
- Channel overlap between routers.  
**Fix:**  
- Check signal strength.  
- Change Wi-Fi channels.  
- Reconfigure security settings (WPA2/WPA3).  

---

## 🚦 Network Monitoring and Maintenance

### 🔹 Preventive Measures
- Keep **firmware and software updated**.  
- Enable **logging and alerts** for unusual behavior.  
- Perform **regular backups** of configurations.  
- Use **redundancy** (multiple links, power supplies).  

### 🔹 Performance Metrics
- **Latency (ms)** – delay between request and response.  
- **Throughput (Mbps)** – data transfer rate.  
- **Packet loss (%)** – packets that never arrive.  
- **Jitter (ms)** – variation in delay (critical for VoIP).  

Monitoring these ensures consistent service quality.
